Aadhaar,

Here is the project workflow:

1. Use a Chrome Extension to trap url requests

2. Check for malformed url's

3. Check against known bad databases (example https://zeltser.com/malicious-ip-blocklists/)

4. Check against good url's of banks, online payment gateways to prevent payment frauds


Second Phase:
1. Create a secure VM (sandbox) on the host computer or on a cloud

2. Download everything on to the VM and let it run

3. Observe the environment to check for ransomware etc.

4. If OK download to host computer

Third Phase:
1. Use AI and RPA to make it smart

Possible outcomes from the project:
1. Paper
2. Working Prototype
3. Pitch to DRDO for funding
4. Possible Patents etc. 
5. Pitch to armed forces/govt. to use
6. Raise funding and incubate startup

All the best
